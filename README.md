## Python 3.5 Quick Reference

Based on the [Python 2.7 Quick Reference](https://github.com/justmarkham/python-reference) from [Kevin Markham](https://github.com/justmarkham):

*This is the [reference guide to Python](reference.py) that I **wish** had existed when I was learning the language.*

Here's what a reference guide should provide:

- **High-quality examples** that show the simplest possible usage of a given feature
- **Explanatory comments**, and descriptive variable names that eliminate the need for some comments
- Presented as a **single Python script**, so that I can keep it open in my IDE and search it when needed
- **Code that can be run** from top to bottom, with the relevant objects defined nearby

This is **not** written as a full-fledged Python tutorial, though topics are ordered such that you can read it like a tutorial (i.e., each topic depends only on material preceding it).

### Table of Contents

### Other Python Resources

If you like the general format of this guide, but need **more explanation of each topic**, reading the Appendix of [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do) is highly recommended. It presents the essentials of the Python language in a clear and focused manner.

If you are looking for a resource that will help you to **learn Python from scratch**, this is [a list of recommended resources](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT8#python-resources).

### Suggestions or Corrections

If there's a **topic or example** you'd like me to add to this guide, or you notice a **mistake**, please [create a GitHub issue](../../issues) or contact me directly.
